<b>Git Hints</b>

To make your start easier I compiled a list of git commands that I've been using to create this repo.

//First I create the repo locally.
git init

//I then move the files into staging
git add .

//I commit them to my local repository.
git commit -m "Initial Commit"

//Now I need to add them to the remote repository
remote add origin https://github.com/pchrz/A_Hunting_We_Will_Go.git

//Confirm remote repo connection
git remote -v

//Push changes to remote repository
git push origin master

<i> I will add process to branch and merge song info. I will test it first with an alternate github account. </i>
