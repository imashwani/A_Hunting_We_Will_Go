This is the github practice repo to the Fall 2019 - Udacity Bertlesmann Scholarship Cloud DevOps challange.

To practice the github lessons we can share merging, branching and editing the public domain song "A Hunting We Will Go". The lyrics of which can be found at the following site, https://www.funnysongsforkids.com/childrens-classics/a-hunting-we-will-go

I will start off the project by posting the final verse. :) Please submit requests, fork the project and test your git skills!
