This is the github practice repo to the Fall 2019 - Udacity Bertlesmann Scholarship Cloud DevOps challange.

<b>Purpose:</b>
To practice the github lessons we can share merging, branching and editing the public domain song "A Hunting We Will Go". Using a song will be an easier start than code. 

Lets push hard and break things. Better to understand errors now than in production!!

<b>Ready, Set, Code:</b>
I will start off the project by posting the final verse. :) Please grab a verse, line or word then branch the project, merge your changes and test your git skills! 


<b>Lyrics:</b>

	A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
	Heigh ho, the dairy-o, a hunting we will go
	A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
	We'll catch a fox and put him in a box
	And then we'll let him go

	A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
	Heigh ho, the dairy-o, a hunting we will go
	A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
	We'll catch a fish and put him on a dish
	And then we'll let him go

	A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
	Heigh ho, the dairy-o, a hunting we will go
	A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
	We'll catch a bear and cut his hair
	And then we'll let him go

	A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
	Heigh ho, the dairy-o, a hunting we will go
	A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
	We'll catch a pig and dance a little jig
	And then we'll let him go

	A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
	Heigh ho, the dairy-o, a hunting we will go
	A hunting we will go, a hunting we will go
	We'll catch a giraffe and make him laugh
	And then we'll let him go !
